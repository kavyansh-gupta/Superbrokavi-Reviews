  </strong>
  <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;">Bridgerton is an American streaming television period drama series created by Chris Van Dusen and produced by Shonda Rhimes. It is based on Julia Quinn's novels set in the competitive world of Regency
    era London's ton during the season, when debutantes are presented at court. It is Rhimes's first scripted Netflix series.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;">Set against the backdrop of Regency era London, the Bridgerton siblings – Anthony, Benedict, Colin, Daphne, Eloise, Francesca, Gregory and Hyacinth – navigate the London society in search of love,
    surrounded by friends and rivals alike. Each episode includes narration by Lady whistledown, who voices the anonymous and ever-scandalous newsletter columnist known as Lady Whistledown, who possesses knowledge of all the information in
    London, drawing everyone's interest, even Queen Charlotte. </p>

    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:40px;">Review </p>
  </strong>
  <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;">First of all, The show is a good starting point for anyone wanting to watch
    Romance/drama genre but don't know where to start as it has a really good narrator to actually tell what is happening what
    happend earlier. I know you can give the audience a great backstory without using a narrator and
    flashbacks(for eg. Game of Thrones), but its a really good tool to use for attracting new audiences to a genre.Also a side note, the main
    POV character is a female.yes, there is duke and his backstory with his POV but still a lot of plot is centred around Daphne
    So you might enjoy the show more if you're female.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;"> The setting of a show is great,Its rare to find Romance/Drama Genre in this timeline.
    The acting,visuals and music were great, i specially liked when they played "Girls Like you" and other mordern music on classical piano
    lol, I think that was a great touch. </p>

    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;">I think the story is kind of a mess really, if you want to read me ranting about it then i would summarize it for you guys in some bullet points</p>
    <strong><p style="text-align:left;font-size:25px;">The Good</p></strong>
    <ul style="text-align:left;font-size:25px;">
      <li>Elosie's story and character was good and I wish to see more of her storyline in S2</li>
      <li>Mystery of Lady whistledown</li>
      <li>Duke's Backstory</li>
      <li>The concept of miss thompson's story and the buid-up, but they concluded her story pretty badly</li>
      <li>some lord featherington scenes with duke's boxer(they don't even tell name of 2nd most important family's lord in the show)</li>
    </ul>
    <strong><p style="text-align:left;font-size:25px;">The Bad </p></strong>
    <ul style="text-align:left;font-size:25px;">
     <li>The main story is really repetitve,pridictible and quite boring</li>
      <li>Most of the converstions that happen are useless</li>
      <li>The main story is copied from another show</li>
      <li>Lazy writers - 95% of the important scenes happen during a party, from introducing villans to moving plots.</li>
      <li>Miss thompson's ending</li>
      <li>characters just going 180 degree and suddenly changing in some episodes and returing back(for eg. Daphne in Ep-7)</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
  <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;"> There are many many subplots which no one
    cares about and some of them have a very underwhelming ending like miss thompson.a lot of dialogue is just useless conversation that doesn't go
    anywhere. The main thing that i did not like about the lazy writers was that they couldn't even create one meaningfull conversation
    that actually helped the plot outside of a party/event. like i get it that a marrige season is going on and hence a lot parties are going
    on but you don't have to introduce villans like burbrook and  move plot like daphne and duke getting attached in a event.The
    show is incredibly boring because its slow and repitive.Like to tell how boring the plot is, just look at the main story,they're neutral towards each other in the first episode then they start
    to develop a relationship,then they are away from each other when duke tells them they were never friends then they get back togeather
    and marry,then they're again dissapointed with each other then they're again happy with each other and have a child. This was the most
    stupid and boring plot in history of telivision and after that, this incredible boring plot is copied from "To all the boys I've loved before".There are some parts of the story that are good like Duke's backstory and mystery of
    whistledown but the majyority of scenes are boring as hell and were a huge dissapointment I can still go on for so long to tell how
    stupid the plot is but that would be pretty boring.</p>

  <strong><p style="text-align:center;font-size:40px;">Final rating - (7.5/10)</p></strong>
