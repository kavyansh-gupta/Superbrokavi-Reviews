  </strong>
  <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;">Squid Game was released worldwide on September 17, 2021, to critical acclaim and international attention. As of November 2021, it is Netflix's most-watched series, becoming the top-viewed program in 94
    countries and attracting more than 142 million member households and amassing 1.65 billion viewing hours during its first four weeks from launch, surpassing <a href="Bridgerton.html">Bridgerton</a> for the title of most watched show.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;">The series revolves around a contest where 456 players, all of whom are in deep financial debt, risk their lives to play a series of deadly children's games for the chance to win a â‚©45.6 billion prize.
    The title of the series draws from a similarly named Korean children's game. Hwang had conceived of the idea based on his own economic struggles early in life, as well as the class disparity in South Korea and capitalism. Though he had initially
    written it in 2009, he was unable to find a production company to fund the idea until Netflix took an interest around 2019 as part of their drive to expand their foreign programming offerings. All nine episodes were written and directed by Hwang.

  <p style="text-align:center;font-size:40px;">Squid Game Review </p>
  <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;">First of all, the concept of the show is fantastic. like netflix went like, We want a show
    that has the exact opposite themes.So, what did they go for? Innocent Childhood games combined with the most violent gun gore.
    The concept of last one standing wins is kinna old. like in hunger games but it's done fantastically.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;"> The plot is simple and effective. We follow 456 players who are suffering in the
    world, so they are given a choice. Play simple children's games, Die here quick or live rest of your life luxurious if you survive till the end. Otherwise suffer in the normal world
    slowly and poor. I think this reflects our world and give us realisation of the suffering of the poor and helpless</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;">The story focuses on our protagnists, Gi-hun and Il-Nam, and like rest of the players,
    they aren't doing really good out in the world.Gi-hun is a divorced and unemployed 46 yo,who lives with his poor and diabetic mom and earns money
    by gambling.Il-nam is the first person that gi - hun meets before the games,he is the oldest person in the games,has no family
    to take care of him and is suffering from a memory loss so severe that he can't remember his name.</p>
<hr>
  <strong>
    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;"> Now I will cover some general things in bullet points before talking about what went right and how they ruined it in the end.</p>
  </strong>
  <ul style="text-align:left;font-size:25px;">
    <li>Actual Games are tense and exiting.My favourite game among all being the marbles for the impact on the story. </li>
    <li>Acting is good(in korean, english dub could have been better)</li>
    <li>There are no overcoplicated characters like <a href="Bridgerton.html">Bridgerton</a> , they fill up thier roles pretty well.</li>
    <li>mystery of front man is good, and I would like to see flashbacks of him in S2.</li>
    <li>if it hadn't been a bad twist ending, this show would have been flawless</li>
    <li>VIPS are just Badly written.They just wanted to show Rich = Bad, they didn't need to make thier dialogue look like it was made by a 14yo for doing this.</li>
  </ul>

    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;">Soo want went right and wrong?(Contains spoilers)</p>
  </strong>
  <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;">in episode 6(which is my favourite),they play a game called marbles and they have to a make a pair of two, no one
    wants to team up with the old man, because everyone believes that he is a liability. Gi-Hun,depite having better options
    goes with il-nam because they were friends.But as it turns out,this game wasn't about teamwork, it was a game in which team members fought each other
    in a marbel game.There are 10 marbles givin to each of the player.The player who guesses odd/even marbles wins marbles and eventually win.The other one is killed.
    as it turns out, the old man is pretty damn lucky and gi hun comes to his last marble, which results in this scene </p>

      allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
  < <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;"> So gi-hun's character breaks and he is forced to lie to his friend to get marbles.
    After this Gi-hun wins some marbles and eventually has 19 marbles. The old man then tells him to wajer it all for one marble
    and confronts him that he tricked him into giving him marbles. because gi hun showed kindness to the old man, he willinly
    gives gi-hun the marble and thanks him for giving him such an fantastic last moments. Soooo how do you ruin such a exellent scene- By unnescesary twist no one asked for</p>

    <strong>
      <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;">how did they ruin it?</p>
    </strong>
    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;">So gi-hun wins the games, a year passes by without him spending any on the money because he was too traumatized by the Games
      and for not being able to save his mom's life,after that he recieves a card from the old man and a q/a session happen.
      Sooo it turns out old man is not dead and is one of the founders of the games.This was a really bad twist. this litrally just
      contradicts front man so much. he killed the doctor and a worker for telling the docter the next games and gave a speach about how
      everyone is equal in this place when Il-Nam already knew all of the games and had strategies of 30 years of players.
      are some players more equal than others????
      and his answer to why he started the games was pretty dull. like just some rich people got bored???really netflix??
      from the front man speach i thought whoever made these games wanted a weird way equality that Die here quick or live
      rest of your life luxurious if you win.Otherwise suffer in the normal world slowly and poor.
      "What a great way to go" its easy to say that when you aren't going to die. like why did this twist happen in the First place
      ? all it did was just ans some minor question,talk about some rich and poor,talk about how he created the games and the rest of it just ruined the "equality" theme of show.</p>
      <hr>
    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;"> if the ending would have been better then i would rated it 9.5, but it is what it is</p>
    <strong>
      <p style="text-align:center;font-size:40px;">Final rating - (8.5/10)</p>
